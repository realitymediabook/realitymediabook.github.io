AR and VR have a history that dates back at least to the 1960s (and in some sense much earlier). They are the latest in a lineage of <a href="chapter02.html"> reality media</a>. But they spent decades in the labs of computer scientists or were used for specialized and expensive applications by the military. As widely available consumer technologies, both are a little more than a decade old. Smart phones and inexpensive headsets such as the Oculus Quest are turning them into platforms for a variety of media genres. 

As we argue in the printed book, AR and VR, like all reality media, enter into our media culture through the process of remediation.
