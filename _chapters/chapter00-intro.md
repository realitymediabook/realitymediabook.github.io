RELATED CHAPTER (in printed book): Introduction

The printed book aims to define the concept of <i>reality media</i> and show how augmented and virtual reality fit into that definition. The two words are equally important in describing all such media, including film and television in additon to AR and VR. They all aspire to imitate or even to supplant our experience of everyday reality). But they never fully succeed in this aspiration, and eventually we are always reminded that they are technologies mediating reality rather than supplantig it.

This room seeks to capture the double-sided nature of reality media: the strategies film, television, VR and AR use to disappear as media and the ways in which the technologies and techniques of mediation reassert themselves for us as viewers. We watch a film and engaged in the story and the world depicted. But we never entirely forget the fact that we are in a theater watching the screen or sitting on an airplane with a laptop.

The immersive gallery illustrates the concept through two videos. [How about panoramic videos in spheres- the theater twice: once with la Ciotat playing and one with the engine broken through the walls? Could use audio kiosks for the sound or just play the sound in this case.]


#### The La Ciotat Effect

<blockquote>One of our key concepts is what we call the "La Ciotat Effect." We take the name from a legend that grew up around one of the first films shown....</blockquote>

We explain the origin of our thinking about the la Ciotat Effect and how it can unite motives throughout the book. Explain here how we see la Ciotat returning throughout the printed book. Two-fold nature of reality media is implied throughout the immersive book as well. 


<blockquote>The material below belongs in the room itself - not on the web. </blockquote>

audio
In January 1896 an audience in the Salon Indien of the Grand Café in Paris attended one of the first public demonstrations of the Lumière brothers’ all-in-one camera and projector: the cinématographe. One of the films shown was “The Arrival of the Train at la Ciotat Station.” All that happens in the approximately 50-second film is that a steam engine and several passenger cars pull into the station and glide to a stop. The passengers descend from their individual compartments.The story goes that some of the viewers panicked. Imagining that the train was going to burst out of the screen into the room, they left their seats and ran for the door. The story is almost certainly apocryphal. Film historian Tom Gunning doubts that an audience of sophisticated Parisians at the turn of the twentieth century could be fooled into thinking that a train could suddenly materialize and crush them. They were astonished, not fooled, and what astonished them was that moving images could seem so real. They were astonished not by reality, but by a reality medium. 

Film soon became one of the most important reality media of the twentieth century, and it is a forerunner of Virtual Reality. If you click on the image above, you enter an exhibit that will be part of the first room of <i>RealityMedia</i>. You will be transported to the Salon Indien rendered in the 3D graphics, where virtual spectators view the Lumière brother's film.
