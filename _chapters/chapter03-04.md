This gallery corresponds to two chapters in the printed *Reality Media*:

####Constructing visual reality
Chapter 3 introduces principles of computer graphics (CG) that both AR and VR depend on to construct their version of visual reality for the viewer. 
In 3D CG, computer hardware and software must explicitly create all the elements of the scene that analog and even digital photography get "for free" when they focus 
and record the light from the world. The form and shape of the objects, the lighting and shading of the scene, and (for moving objects in a CG world) the physical behavior 
must all be calculated and recalulated each time the user moves their head and changes perspective. 
Photorealism, the holy grail of computer graphics for decades, is often understood as making a CG scene that is indistinguishable from reality. 
But, as the name suggests, it measures reality in terms of photography (and film). A photorealistic image would be indistinguihable from a photograph. 
A photorealistic animation would seem to be a live action film. 
So a perfect photorealistic graphic would achieve for the digital medium what the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/chapters/chapter00-intro.html">LaCiotat myth</a> promised for film.

We argue in *Reality Media* that in film the LaCiotat myth is never realized. The viewer always knows at some intuitive level that she is a film. 
What shes experiences is the double character of the LaCiotat effect. In the case of CG, when perfect photorealism falls short, the image or animation leads  to a feeling of the uncanny. 

The term *uncanny valley* is used to describe CG images, particularly of humans, that come close to perfect photorealism, but do not achieve it. 
They seem eerie. The assumption is that it is better to be a cartoon character than an eerie almost-human image in 2D or 3D.

<img class="img img--fullContainer img--10xLeading" src="{{ site.baseurl_book_img }}uncanny.jpg"> 
<div style="font-size:.8rem";>(Do we have permission to use this?) </div>
</div>

We argue in the book that the uncanny is not bug, but rather a feature of all reality media. A sense of the uncanny is another name for the la Ciotat effect. The audience of the Lumi√®re brothers' film had the same feeling as they watched the approach of a train that they knew could not be real. The uncanny can provoke a feeling of wonder as well as uneasiness. 

In the first room of the gallery, we illustrate principles of computer graphics. You will also find videos explaining the uncanny valley and unfortunately ignoring the la Ciotat effect. 


####Sensing and tracking
Chapter 4 describes how the computer tracks the user's place in the mediated worlds of AR and VR

They fashion a space in which digital materials (text, 2-D and 3-D graphic objects, and video and other media) become dynamic and responsive to the user. This responsiveness contributes to the La Ciotat effect of these new media. Makes the space uncanny, as we explore in Presence and Privacy chapters.
