Two parts to this page [matching the room - which has two galleries]

1. Constructing visual reality
Constructing visual reality from scratch through principles of computer graphics and realizing it in the hardware of computer and display devices, as discussed in the book and illustrated in the room. 

The LaCiotat myth, the underlying desire to fashion visual reality,  just as in the earlier technologies of the History chapter finds expression here as photorealism, which leads in turn to the uncanny, the LaCiotat effect of both and. 

2. The userâ€™s place in the mediated worlds of AR and VR

They fashion a space in which digital materials (text, 2-D and 3-D graphic objects, and video and other media) become dynamic and responsive to the user. This responsiveness contributes to the La Ciotat effect of these new media. Makes the space uncanny, as we explore in Presence and Privacy chapters.
