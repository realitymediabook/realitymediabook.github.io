This gallery corresponds to two chapters in the printed *Reality Media*:

####Constructing visual reality
Chapter 3 introduces some principles of computer graphics (CG), which both AR and especially VR depend on to construct their version of visual reality for the viewer. In 3D CG, computer hardware and software must painstakingly recreate all the elements of the scene that analog and even digital photography get "for free" as they focus and record the light from the world. The form and shape of the objects, the lighting and shading of the scene, and (for moving objects in a CG world) the physical behavior must all be calculated and recalulated each time the user moves their head and so changes perspective. 

Photorealism has been the Holy Grail of computer graphics for decades....

As we have <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/chapters/chapter00-intro.html">mentioned </a>, the LaCiotat myth, the underlying desire to fashion visual reality,  just as in the earlier technologies of the History chapter finds expression here as photorealism, which leads in turn to the uncanny, the LaCiotat effect of both and. 

The uncanny


####Sensing and tracking
Chapter 4 describes how the computer tracks the user's place in the mediated worlds of AR and VR

They fashion a space in which digital materials (text, 2-D and 3-D graphic objects, and video and other media) become dynamic and responsive to the user. This responsiveness contributes to the La Ciotat effect of these new media. Makes the space uncanny, as we explore in Presence and Privacy chapters.
