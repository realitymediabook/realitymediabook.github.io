This gallery corresponds to two chapters in the printed *Reality Media*:

####Constructing visual reality
Chapter 3 introduces principles of computer graphics (CG) that both AR and especially VR depend on to construct their version of visual reality for the viewer. In 3D CG, computer hardware and software must painstakingly create all the elements of the scene that analog and even digital photography get "for free" when they focus and record the light from the world. The form and shape of the objects, the lighting and shading of the scene, and (for moving objects in a CG world) the physical behavior must all be calculated and recalulated each time the user moves their head and so changes perspective. 

Photorealism has been the Holy Grail of computer graphics for decades. It is often understood as making a CG scene that is indistinguishable from reality. But, as the name indicates, it measures reality in terms of photography (and film). A photorealistic image would be indistinguihable from a photograph. A photorealistic animation would seem to be a live action film. So a perfect photorealistic graphic would achieve for the digital medium what the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/chapters/chapter00-intro.html">LaCiotat myth</a> promised for film.

We argue in *Reality Media* that in film the LaCiotat myth is never realized. The viewer always knows at some intuitive level that she is a film. What shes] experiences is the ambivalence of the LaCiotat effect. In the case of CG, when perfect photorealism falls short, the image or animation leads to a feeling of the uncanny. 

The uncanny


####Sensing and tracking
Chapter 4 describes how the computer tracks the user's place in the mediated worlds of AR and VR

They fashion a space in which digital materials (text, 2-D and 3-D graphic objects, and video and other media) become dynamic and responsive to the user. This responsiveness contributes to the La Ciotat effect of these new media. Makes the space uncanny, as we explore in Presence and Privacy chapters.
