Like other galleries in our immersive book, the Presence and Aura gallery is divided into two rooms,one devoted to each of its topics. 

####Presence
As a concept in philosophy, the idea of presence has been important for thinkers as early as Plato and as recent as Heidegger and Derrida. For computer researchers working on VR, the term becomes important in 1992, when the journal called *Presence* was first published. Just as <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/chapters/chapter03-04.html">photorealism</a> had become the goal of computer graphics, presence became the goal of VR. The ideal VR system would lead the user to feel that she was actually in CG world. The VR world would become her reality. We note in *Reality Media* that no current VR can deceive its users so completely. A feeling of presence is always accompanied by some residual or recurring awareness of technology. The La Ciotat myth always gives way to the La Ciotat effect. 

Computer specialists have offered a variety of definitions of presence, including 

 * transportation: the feeling of being taken to another place/world;
 * immersion: the feeling of being surrounded by a virtual world;
 * realism: the sense of reality of the represented world;
 * social richness: for multi-person experiences, the sense of being.

We provide examples in the first room of the gallery, along with a 3D model of the experiment conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina to test for presence. What experiments and the evidence of compelling examples suggest is that fully deceiving the user is not necessary for a sense of presence. 

The physiological responses that VR can evoke can in fact confirm a feeling of presence, but they can also erase it. The term *cybersickness* has been coined to describe symptoms including headache, nausea, eyestrain, dizziness, fatigue, or even vomiting that may occur during or after exposure to a virtual environment. Those symptoms provide visceral evidence that VR is not a medium to end all media. They break not only the La Ciotat myth, but even the La Ciotat effect.

####Aura
Aura is a particular kind of presence. The term in this sense comes from the media scholar Walter Benjamin, writing in the 1930s, long before digital media. Benjamin argued that the media technologies of his day, film and photography, diminished the aura of traditional artistic media, such as painting. You can only expierence da Vinci's Mona Lisa in the Louvre in Paris. There is only one authentic version, with a unique history that stretches from its creation in the early 16th century in Florenz to its exhibition in the Louvre at the end of the 18th. By contrast, you can experience what is essentially the same movie anywhere by watching any good copy. We can bring Benjaminâ€™s concept into the present and ask about the status of VR and AR. It seems clear that VR generally lacks aura,in Benjamin's sense. VR worlds are generally detached from the unique experience of this world. You can have the same VR experience anywhere. But at least some AR experiences are geolocated, linked directly to the places in this world&mdash;for example, a 3D recreation of the Parthenon that you can only see if you visit the Acropolis in Athens. AR cultural heritage applications for historic sites can be said to appropriate and perhaps even enhance the aura of the site. 

We provide examples in the second room of the gallery.
