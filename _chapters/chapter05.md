[This will point to a room with two galleries - one for Presence and one for Aura]

The lesson of the chapter is that VR and AR cannot deceive their users into believing that they are having a non-mediated experience. But that is not necessary for a sense of presence.

Presence gallery
Various definitions of presence with examples in the room. The Pit experiment is the centerpiece of the room. 

Aura gallery
Aura is a special kind of presence, particularly associated with certain forms of AR, rather than VR.
