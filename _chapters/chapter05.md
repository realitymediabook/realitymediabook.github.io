The Presence and Aura Gallery is also divided into two rooms, one devoted to each topic. 

####Presence
As a philosophical concept, *presence* has been important for thinkers as early as Plato and as recent as Heidegger and Derrida. For computer researchers working on VR, the term gained currency when the journal *Presence* first appeared in 1992. Just as <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/chapters/chapter03-04.html">photorealism</a> had become the goal of computer graphics, presence became the goal of VR. The ideal VR system would lead the user to feel that she was actually in CG world. The VR world would become her reality. We note in *Reality Media* that no current VR can deceive its users so completely. A feeling of presence is always accompanied by some residual or recurring awareness of technology. The La Ciotat myth always gives way to the La Ciotat effect. 

Computer specialists have offered a variety of definitions of presence, including: 

 * transportation: the feeling of being taken to another place/world;
 * immersion: the feeling of being surrounded by a virtual world;
 * realism: the sense of reality of the represented world;
 * social richness: for multi-person experiences, the sense of being together with others.

We provide examples in the first room of the gallery, along with portal to a 3D model of the experiment conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina to test for presence. In this experiment researchers tried to evoke a fear of heights in test subjects by having them walk close to and peer over the edge of a virtual pit. They then measured the subjects' physiological reactions, such as heart rate and skin conductance. In framing this experiment, the researchers were implicitly arguing that physical fear was evidence of presence (a version of the "realism" definition). One thing that experiment suggested is that fully deceiving the user is not necessary for a sense of presence. Full photorealistic immersion in the pit experiment was not possible, but subjects still reacted to the pit <a class="xrlink" room="4" waypoint="start"></a>. 

The physiological responses that VR can evoke can in fact confirm a feeling of presence, but they can also erase it. The term *cybersickness* has been coined to describe symptoms including headache, nausea, eyestrain, dizziness, fatigue, or even vomiting that may occur during or after exposure to a virtual environment. Those symptoms provide visceral evidence that VR is not a medium to end all media. They break not only the La Ciotat myth, but even the La Ciotat effect.

####Aura
Aura is a special kind of presence. The term in this sense comes from the media scholar Walter Benjamin, writing in the 1930s, long before digital media. Benjamin argued that the media technologies of his day, film and photography, diminished the aura of earlier media, such as painting. You can only experience da Vinci's *Mona Lisa* in the Louvre in Paris. There is only one authentic painting. But you can experience what is essentially the same movie anywhere by watching any good copy. We can bring Benjaminâ€™s concept into the present and ask about the status of VR and AR. It seems clear that VR generally lacks aura in Benjamin's sense. VR worlds are generally detached from the unique experience of this world. You can have the same VR experience anywhere. But at least some AR experiences are geolocated, linked directly to the places in this world&mdash;for example, a 3D recreation of the Parthenon that you can only see if you visit the Acropolis in Athens <a class="xrlink" room="5" waypoint="start"></a>. AR cultural heritage applications for historic sites can be said to appropriate and perhaps even enhance the aura of the site.
