This webpage introduces you to the Hubs environment that is the platform for *RealityMedia*. You can experience this introduction immersively in the environment itself by following this portal: 

 {% include hubslink.html room="0" waypoint="start" text="this portal" %}

Or you can read this page and then enter the portal (at the bottom of the page). A guide to using Mozilla Hubs is available on their <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/intro-hubs.html" target="blank">site</a>. Here are the highlights:

##### Entering a Hubs room

*Before entering, you are in the room's lobby. From here, you can see and hear what's going on inside the room, but you can only interact with others using text chat. To enter the room:*

- *on a desktop or mobile device, follow the prompts to select a name/avatar and enable the mic.*
- *on a VR headset, if you opened the URL on your desktop or smartphone, choose "Enter on Standalone VR" to create a code that makes it easy to open on your standalone headset. Open the browser in your VR headset, navigate to hubs.link and enter the code.*

##### Navigating in Hubs

*On desktop use your WASD or arrow keys to move around. You can also press your right mouse button to teleport to a different location. Rotate your view using the Q and E keys, or hold down your left mouse button and drag.*

*For VR and mobile controls, see the list of <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/hubs-controls.html" target="blank">Hubs controls </a>.*

##### Features and controls

*The key below indicates how to mute your microphone, take photos, share your screen, create media objects, and so on:*
