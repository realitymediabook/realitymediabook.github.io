*Reality Media*, the immersive book, is realized a suite of Hubs rooms divided into galleries and linked by portals.
The features of 


##### Using the Hubs platform

*Realitymedia* is built on top of Mozilla's open-source <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/cloud" target="blank">Hubs Cloud</a> platform. 

You enter into one of the 3D galleries by clicking on the portal (<i class="fas fa-vr-cardboard"></i>) symbol. 

For example, to learn how to navigate and use the 3D platform, you can visit the  <a class="xrlink" room=0 waypoint="onboarding">Onboarding Area</a>.  Whether you visit the onboarding area or not, we encourage you to read this page and then enter the starting portal (the link is at the bottom of the page).

A guide to using Mozilla Hubs is available at <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/intro-hubs.html" target="blank">in the Hubs user documentation</a>. Here are the highlights:

##### Entering a Hubs room

*Before entering, you are in the room's lobby. From here, you can see and hear what's going on inside the room, but you can only interact with others using text chat. To enter the room:*

- *on a desktop or mobile device, follow the prompts to select a name/avatar and enable the mic.*
- *on a VR headset, if you opened the URL on your desktop or smartphone, choose "Enter on Standalone VR" to create a code that makes it easy to open on your standalone headset. Open the browser in your VR headset, navigate to hubs.link and enter the code.*

##### Navigating in Hubs

*On desktop use your WASD or arrow keys to move around. You can also press your right mouse button to teleport to a different location. Rotate your view using the Q and E keys, or hold down your left mouse button and drag.*

*For VR and mobile controls, see the list of <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/hubs-controls.html" target="blank">Hubs controls </a>.*

##### Features and controls
