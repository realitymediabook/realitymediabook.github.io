[Three galleries connected by portals: the probable gallery, the plausible gallery and then the possible which is where the myths of AR and VR are expressed - perhaps the galleries get larger.]

Probable gallery: smartphone AR and VR games and entertainment

Plausible gallery: large-scale VR conferencing. Widespread AR use. 

Possible: the two myths of total AR and VR.
We can appreciate the meaning of AR and VR as media through the myths that they generate.
We spell out the three-fold division of probable, plausible and possible are steps along the way to total AR and VR. We invoked the LaCiotat legend at the beginning. 
The myths of total VR and AR are not in fact the fulfillment of the LaCiotat myth. We could say instead that they would constitute a full acceptance of the LaCiotat effect.
