In *Speculative Everything* Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby suggest three categories for imagining the future, ranging the most likely to the least: the probable, the plausible, and the possible. (For Dunne and Raby, a fourth categpry, the preferable, is a subset of what is probable and plausible.)

Our gallery of the future consists of three rooms housing the three categories in consecutive order.

In the room of the Probable, VR headsets become the preferred platform for 3D computer games,and AR applications on smartphones provide hundreds of millions of users with navigation aids. Social media is extended into VR and AR. 

In the room of the Plausible, VR conferencing takes its place along video-conferncing. AR headsets are worn in public by more and more people. 

In the third room, the room of the possible, AR and VR are taken to their limits. The film critic Andr√© Breton wrote an essay in 194x entitiled "The Myth of Total Cinema," in which he imagined the ultimate goal of cinema as the perfected representation of the real. In *Reality Media* we take his phrase and apply it to AR and VR. We can appreciate the meaning of AR and VR as media through the myths that they generate. 

The realization of the myth of total VR would be hardware and software that presents a seamless digital world, in which the user feels perfectly present, their sense of sight, sound, and touch, and perhaps smell and taste perfectly engaged. It might be a game world like the Oasis in *Ready Player One*, where as the narrator says, people come for all the things they can do and stay for all the things they can be. 

The realization of myth of AR would be the Cloud that contains a complete and constantly updated 3D replica of our world, together with all the location-based information about that world that the Internet can provide&mdash;all the data about the businesses, organizations, and individual occupying the buildings, all the dynamic data about the planes, busses, and cars that travel over and through the city, all the films being shown and concerts taking place, and so on. 

The myths of total VR and AR are not in fact the fulfillment of the LaCiotat myth. We could say instead that they would constitute a full acceptance of the LaCiotat effect. 

[Three galleries connected by portals: the probable gallery, the plausible gallery and then the possible which is where the myths of AR and VR are expressed - perhaps the galleries get larger.]
