The history of AR, VR, and Reality Media.
The timeline of the various reality media - can we turn this into a 3d diagram for the room?

This room situates media in history through the process of remediation.
Reality media all seek to capture the real. Yet all of them do so in relation to earlier media. All remediate - all pretend to bypass earlier media, but depend on them. Trompe l’oiel as good example. Situated in architecture and uses the illusionistic painting techniques to go further in that direction. AR and VR as total trompe l’oiel. But also draw on film and video.
