RELATED CHAPTER (in printed book): Preface

Reality Media is a project encompassing three related writing spaces, three technologies for representing ideas: print, the web, and immersive VR and AR. The printed page is a writing space with a tradition dating back to the fifteenth century. The web has a far shorter tradition, beginning around 1990, but in the thirty year since Tim Berner-Lee launched the first web server, the web has grown to rival and for many kinds of communication to surpass print in importance. The technologies of immersive, three-dimensional spaces of AR and VR are actually as old as the technologies of the web. But AR and VR are not typically understood as writing spaces at all. One goal of this project is to demonstrate the potential of the immersive book. 

Each of the three writing spaces has a different ratio between word and image. In most (though not all) printed books, the word is the primary mode of communication. Images serve as illustrations of the ideas and examples expressed in the verbal text. The web space too has a tradition, much shorter but already established, as an extension of the space of print. The ratio and relationship of word and image are more equal or at least open to various ratios of word and image but still 2D, still a page. The immersive book literally adds another dimension. It is a 3D space that you can enter and move through. It invites a different kinds of participation, an extension of the concept of reading. Words, when they appear, function as captions or explanations in relation to the 3D space that you inhabit.  participatory rather than just discursive. inviting a different kind of participation, a metaphorical extension of the concept of reading, (which is why the museum is a good analog. wall copy etc. function as subsidiary to the visual and embodied space of the exhibition. ) 


In the Preface to the printed book, we said that we drew inspiration for this project from Scott McCloud’s <i>Understanding Comics</i>. McCloud’s brilliant book was both an essay on the nature of comics and a comic itself. McCloud was able to insert himself as a character in panels of the comic. But we said that we could not do the same thing for our project because the printed book and the computer belong to different spaces, supported by very different underlying technologies. So our printed book is necessarily separate in form from our two digital format.  Our two digital formats can come closer to what McCloud achieved, if not quite there. Our web pages can perform a function similar to McCloud's own character in <i>Understanding Comics</i>: they can comment on and explain what the immersive spaces illustrate or enact. 

The website sits between the printed book and the immersive book. It belongs to the digital medium, but as a 2D digital text, it shares with the printed book many of the same means of verbal and visual expression. It is designed to point the visitor in two directions: directly into the immersive book through hypertext links and indirectly through chapter references back into the printed book. The printed book describes, analyzes and contextualizes the subject of AR, VR and earlier reality media. The website indicates how the immersive experiences relate to the printed book's argument. 

<h2>Portals</h2>
The web pages constitute a set of portals into the immersive book. Unlike the printed book, the website and the immersive book share the same underlying platform, the computer. The connection between them is almost seamless because of WebXR (described in Chapter 2 of the printed book): passing from a page and its related 3D virtual space and back is just a matter of following a link. 

The portal is a metaphor in the printed book, but it is an operating feature of the web pages and the immersive rooms. There are links on these pages, and there are visual portals in the rooms.

The room portal are passages are the way you navigate from the central rotunda to the individual rooms and sometimes from room to room.

The immersive book consists of a set of galleries that correspond to subjects of the printed book. In addition to the rotunda and introductory area, there are seven galleries that corespond to ten chapters of the printed book. Within each gallery are 3D models, videos, images, and text related to the themes and issues raised in the corresponding chapters. In some of the rooms, you will be invited to interact with the models. Other 3D models or videos simply run and invite you to watch. The rooms are organized around a rotunda as you see in the diagram above.

<h2>Platforms</h2>

RealityMedia can be visited using a range of different hardware and software: on desktops and laptops, on mobiles devices, and on VR (and ultimately AR) headsets. 


1. Browsers that work on PCs and Macs.

2. Phones and Tablets that work

3. Headsets that work


<i> NOTE: List of platforms/interfaces is promised in print version: “You will find a list of devices and browsers with which the book can currently be used at https://realitymedia.digital/devices”. So we need that link to work. And point to the text above. </i>
