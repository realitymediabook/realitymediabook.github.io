RELATED CHAPTER (in printed book): Preface


<blockquote>The digital version of Reality Media is a complement to, not a substitute for, the printed version. This digital version allows you to get inside AR and VR, to inhabit these new reality media.</blockquote>

Reality Media is a project encompassing three related writing spaces, three technologies for representing ideas: print, the web, and immersive AR and VR. The printed page is a writing space with a tradition dating back to the fifteenth century. The web has a far shorter tradition, beginning around 1990, but in the thirty year since Tim Berner-Lee launched the first web server, the web has grown to rival and for many kinds of communication to surpass print in importance. The technologies of immersive, three-dimensional spaces of AR and VR are actually as old as the technologies of the web. But AR and VR are not typically understood as writing spaces at all. One goal of this project is to demonstrate the potential of the immersive book. 

Each of the three writing spaces has differnet ratio between and image. In most (though not all) printed books, the word is the primary mode of communication. Images serve as illustrations of the ideas and examples expressed in the verbal text. The web space too has a tradition, much shorter but already established, as an extension of the space of print. The ratio and relationship of word and image are more equal or at least open to various ratios of word and image but still 2D, still a page. Web site can function as a portal into the immersive spaces.  The immersive book adds another order of communication. Words, when they appear, function as captions or explanations in relation to 3D space that you enter. @@@ if not really embodied space of the experience. participatory rather than just discursive. inviting a different kind of participation, a metaphorical extension of the concept of reading, (which is why the museum is a good analog. wall copy etc. function as subsidiary to the visual and embodied space of the exhibition. ) 


In the Preface to the printed book, we said that we drew inspiration for this project from Scott McCloud’s <i>Understanding Comics</i>. McCloud’s brilliant book was both an essay on the nature of comics and a comic itself. McCloud was able to insert himself as a character in panels of the comic. But we said that we could not do the same thing for our project because the printed book and the computer belong to different spaces, supported by very different underlying technologies. So our printed book is necessarily separate in form from our two digital format.  Our two digital formats can come closer to what McCloud achieved, if not quite there. Our web pages can perform a function similar to McCloud's own character in <i>Understanding Comics</i>: they can comment on and explain what the immersive spaces illustrate or enact. 

The website stands between the printed book and the immersive book. It belongs to the digital medium, but as a 2D digital text, it shares with the printed book many of the same means of expression. It is mostly words and images. It is designed to point the visitor in two directions: directly into the immersive book through hypertextual links and indirectly through chapter references back into the printed book. The printed book describes, analyzes and contextualizes the subject of AR, VR and earlier reality media. The website indicates how the book's analysis relates to the immersive rooms. @@@

<h2>Portals</h2>
These pages constitute a set of portals into the immersive book. Unlike the printed book, the website and the immersive book share the same underlying platform, the computer. The dialogue between them is particularly WebXR (described in Chapter 2 of the printed book), where passing from a page and its related 3D virtual space and back is just a matter of following a link. 

Two-way portal that you can more back and forth through.

The immersive consists of a set of virtual rooms that correspond to the chapters of the printed book. Within each room are 3D models, videos, images, and text related to the themes and issues raised in the corresponding chapter. In some of the rooms, you will be invited to interact with the models. Other 3D models or videos simply run and invite you to watch. The rooms are organized around a rotunda as you see in the diagram above.

NOTE: List of platforms/interfaces as promised in print version: “You will find a list of devices and browsers with which the book can currently be used at https://realitymedia.digital/devices”. So we need that link to work.
