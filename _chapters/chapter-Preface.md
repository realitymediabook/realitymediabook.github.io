RELATED CHAPTER (in printed book): Preface


<blockquote>The digital version of Reality Media is a complement to, not a substitute for, the printed version. This digital version allows you to get inside AR and VR, to inhabit these new reality media.</blockquote>

These pages are portals into the digital book.  unlike the printed book, the website and the digital rooms belong to the same space -- the digital space. This is particularly true because of WebXR, which emphasizes the continuity, the dialogue between the webpage and the spatial. 

The printed page is a writing space with its own long tradition

The web space too has a tradition, much shorter but already established, as a extension of the space of print. Web site is a  portal into the immersive spaces.  Two way portal that you can more back and forth through.

The digital version consists of a set of virtual rooms that correspond to the chapters of the printed book. Within each room are 3D models, videos, images, and text related to the themes and issues raised in the corresponding chapter. In some of the rooms, you will be invited to interact with the models. Other 3D models or videos simply run and invite you to watch. The rooms are organized around a rotunda as you see in the diagram above.
