_Under construction_

These pages are portals into the digital book.  unlike the printed book, the website and the digital rooms belong to the same space -- the digital space. This is particularly true because of WebXR, which emphasizes the continuity, the dialogue between the webpage and the spatial. 

The printed page is a writing space with its own long tradition

The web space too has a tradition, much shorter but already established, as a extension of the space of print. Web site is a  portal into the immersive spaces.  Two way portal that you can more back and forth through.
