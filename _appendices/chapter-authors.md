<h3>The Authors</h3>
The three of us wrote the printed book *Reality Media* and conceived of the web site and immersive book *RealityMedia*. We did not do this alone, collaborating with the designers and developers below to realize *RealityMedia.*  We would also like to thank the dozens of students who participated in our augmented reality design studio at Georgia Tech from 2019-2021.
