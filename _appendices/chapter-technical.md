*Reality Media*, the immersive book, is realized a suite of Hubs rooms divided into galleries and linked by portals.

This 360&#176; image offers a glimpse into one of the galleries (the Genres gallery).  
<div style="margin-top: 20px"> 
<iframe src="https://artnotart.org/jdbolter/pano/" height="400px" width="100%" title="Genres Gallery"></iframe>
</div>

You can scroll around with your mouse. But you cannot enter this space until you follow a portal in gallery.


Explain that the galleries are grouped into Hubs rooms. These rooms are actually web pages too, being rendered on your browser.
