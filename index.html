                The digital version of <i>Reality Media</i> is a complement to, not a substitute for, the printed version. It consists of a set of virtual rooms that generally correspond to the chapters of the printed book. Within each room are 3D models, videos, images, and text related to the themes and issues raised in the corresponding chapter. In some of the rooms, you will be invited to interact with the models. Other 3D models or videos simply run and invite you to watch.

                In January 1896 an audience in the Salon Indien of the Grand Café in Paris attended one of the first public demonstrations of the Lumière brothers’ all-in-one camera and projector: the cinématographe. One of the films shown was “The Arrival of the Train at la Ciotat Station.” All that happens in the approximately 50-second film is that a steam engine and several passenger cars pull into the station and glide to a stop. The passengers descend from their individual compartments.The story goes that some of the viewers panicked. Imagining that the train was going to burst out of the screen into the room, they left their seats and ran for the door

                The story is almost certainly apocryphal. Film historian Tom Gunning doubts that an audience of sophisticated Parisians at the turn of the twentieth century could be fooled into thinking that a train could suddenly materialize and crush them. They were astonished, not fooled, and what astonished them was that moving images could seem so real. They were astonished not by reality, but by a reality medium. Film soon became one of the most important reality media of the twentieth century, and it is a forerunner of Virtual Reality.

                If you click on the image above, you enter the first room of <i>Reality Media</i>. You will be transported to the Salon Indien rendered in the 3D graphics. On the screen you will see a video that introduces you to the concept of reality media. When the engine breaks out of the screen, it crosses the barrier from one reality medium to another: from two-dimensional, live-action film to the 3D graphics of Virtual Reality.
