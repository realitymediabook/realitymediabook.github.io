<blockquote>The digital version of Reality Media is a complement to, not a substitute for, the printed version. This digital version allows you to get inside AR and VR, to inhabit these new reality media.</blockquote>

The digital version consists of a set of virtual rooms that correspond to the chapters of the printed book. Within each room are 3D models, videos, images, and text related to the themes and issues raised in the corresponding chapter. In some of the rooms, you will be invited to interact with the models. Other 3D models or videos simply run and invite you to watch. The rooms are organized around a rotunda as you see in the diagram above.

The entry to the digital book is labelled Introduction, which leads into a room that contains a introductory video. The video appears on a giant screen in the minimal graphic environment resembling the Construct in <i>The Matrix</i>. The narrator explains our key concepts: reality media and the La Ciotat effect. You can enter this room by clicking on the image above. You can also view the introductory video in your browser (without entering Hubs) by clicking <a href="https://artnotart.org/jdbolter/RM/VRvideo10.mp4" target="_blank">here.</a></div>

Disney died from lung cancer on December 15, 1966, in Burbank, California. He left behind a vast legacy, including numerous animated shorts and feature films produced during his lifetime; the company, parks, and animation studio that bear his name; and the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts).

#### The La Ciotat Effect

<blockquote>As the narrator explains, one of our key concepts is what we call the "La Ciotat Effect." We take the name from a legend that grew up around one of the first films shown....</blockquote>

In January 1896 an audience in the Salon Indien of the Grand Café in Paris attended one of the first public demonstrations of the Lumière brothers’ all-in-one camera and projector: the cinématographe. One of the films shown was “The Arrival of the Train at la Ciotat Station.” All that happens in the approximately 50-second film is that a steam engine and several passenger cars pull into the station and glide to a stop. The passengers descend from their individual compartments.The story goes that some of the viewers panicked. Imagining that the train was going to burst out of the screen into the room, they left their seats and ran for the door. The story is almost certainly apocryphal. Film historian Tom Gunning doubts that an audience of sophisticated Parisians at the turn of the twentieth century could be fooled into thinking that a train could suddenly materialize and crush them. They were astonished, not fooled, and what astonished them was that moving images could seem so real. They were astonished not by reality, but by a reality medium.

Film soon became one of the most important reality media of the twentieth century, and it is a forerunner of Virtual Reality. If you click on the image above, you enter an exhibit that will be part of the first room of <i>Reality Media</i>. You will be transported to the Salon Indien rendered in the 3D graphics, where virtual spectators view the Lumière brother's film.
