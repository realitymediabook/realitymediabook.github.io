In order to enter the immersive 3D galleries yourself, you will need to create a (free) account on our 3D immersive site. When you have logged in, the system will create a copy of the immersive book for you, and the links on this site will point at the correct places in your copy of the book.</p> 

<p>We are using the account system included with Mozilla's Hubs Cloud Service, which does not save your email address or any personal information (your email and credentials are stored in your local browser storage).
