<p>In order to enter the immersive 3D galleries yourself, you will need to create a (free) account.  We are using the account system included with Mozilla's Hubs Cloud Service, which does not save your email address or any personal information (your email and credentials are stored in your local browser storage):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://xr.realitymedia.digital/signin" target="_blank">xr.realitymedia.digital</a> and follow the instructions to sign in.</li>
<li>Complete the sign in process by checking your email for the "magic link."</li>
<li>Return to this web page to continue your visit.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>When you have logged in, the system will create a copy of the immersive book for you, and the links on this site will point at the correct places in your copy of the book.</p>
